# Advent of Code 2023

This is an attempt at not using any external tooling from NPM and solely use Node as the runner.
This also means no typescript, but JSDocs are allowed.

## Running

To run, just call the main file with:
```bash
./main.mjs
# OR
node ./main.mjs
```

To run the latest day:
```bash
./main.mjs --latest
# OR
node ./main.mjs --latest
```
